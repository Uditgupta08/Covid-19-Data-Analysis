# COVID-19 Data Analysis Notebook

## Overview
Analyze COVID-19 infection data alongside worldwide happiness data to explore relationships between maximum infection rates and socio-economic factors like GDP per capita.

## Prerequisites
Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
```

## Workflow
1. **Import Modules**: Load necessary libraries.
2. **Load Data**: Import COVID-19 and happiness datasets.
3. **Clean Data**: Drop unnecessary columns and aggregate by country.
4. **Analyze Data**: Calculate maximum infection rates and correlate with happiness factors.
5. **Visualize**: Use scatter and regression plots to explore relationships.

## Files
- `covid19_Confirmed_dataset.csv`: COVID-19 case data.
- `worldwide_happiness_report.csv`: Happiness index data.
- Analysis notebook: Contains code and results.

## Key Findings
- Infection rates vary significantly by country.
- Socio-economic factors, such as GDP per capita, correlate with infection rates.

## How to Run
1. Place datasets in a `Datasets` folder.
2. Run the notebook step by step.
